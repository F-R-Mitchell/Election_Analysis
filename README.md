Python
### Overview

The purpose of this project is to audit the authenticity of a congressional election in multiple counties within Colorado. The commission originally wanted to know the vote county for each candidate and the proportion of vote count compared to the total. After completing the audit, the election commission requested additional data on voter turnout within each county.
