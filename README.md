# Election_Analysis

# Overview

The purpose of this project is to audit the authenticity of a congressional election in multiple counties within Colorado. The commission originally wanted to know the vote county for each candidate and the proportion of vote count compared to the total. After completing the audit, the election commission requested additional data on voter turnout within each county.

# Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used as a foundation for any election. The first clear alteration that would need to be made would be to fit the size of the election. For example, if it were a national election, there would need to be a dictionary to hold each states. Another alteration would be to include the electoral college as we the count of electoral votes.
